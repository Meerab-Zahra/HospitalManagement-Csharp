The Hospital Management System is a Windows Forms application developed in C# using Visual Studio. The application begins with a visually appealing splash screen featuring a loading progress bar, followed by a secure login form. The login system ensures the application runs only when the correct username and passcode are provided, with an optional "Show Passcode" feature for convenience. After successful login, users can access various forms to perform CRUD operations for managing physicians, staff, and patients. The system also supports barcode generation for physicians and includes a print record feature for patient data, with a Print Preview dialog box for reviewing records before printing. This application combines functionality, security, and user-friendly design to streamline hospital management processes.
